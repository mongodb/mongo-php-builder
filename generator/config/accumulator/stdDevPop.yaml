description: |
    Calculates the population standard deviation of the input values. Use if the values encompass the entire population of data you want to represent and do not wish to generalize about a larger population. $stdDevPop ignores non-numeric values.
    If the values represent only a sample of a population of data from which to generalize about the population, use $stdDevSamp instead.
    Changed in version 5.0: Available in the $setWindowFields stage.
