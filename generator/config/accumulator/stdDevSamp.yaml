description: |
    Calculates the sample standard deviation of the input values. Use if the values encompass a sample of a population of data from which to generalize about the population. $stdDevSamp ignores non-numeric values.
    If the values represent the entire population of data or you do not wish to generalize about a larger population, use $stdDevPop instead.
    Changed in MongoDB 5.0: Available in the $setWindowFields stage.
