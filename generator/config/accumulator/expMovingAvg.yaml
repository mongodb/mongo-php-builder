    Returns the exponential moving average for the numeric expression.
    New in version 5.0.
arguments:
    -
        name: input
        type:
            - resolvesToNumber

        name: 'N'
        type:
            - int
        optional: true
        description: |
            An integer that specifies the number of historical documents that have a significant mathematical weight in the exponential moving average calculation, with the most recent documents contributing the most weight.
            You must specify either N or alpha. You cannot specify both.
            The N value is used in this formula to calculate the current result based on the expression value from the current document being read and the previous result of the calculation:

        name: alpha
        type:
            - double
        optional: true
        description: |
            A double that specifies the exponential decay value to use in the exponential moving average calculation. A higher alpha value assigns a lower mathematical significance to previous results from the calculation.
            You must specify either N or alpha. You cannot specify both.
