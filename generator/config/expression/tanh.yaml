        description: |
            $tanh takes any valid expression that resolves to a number, measured in radians. If the expression returns a value in degrees, use the $degreesToRadians operator to convert the value to radians.
            By default $tanh returns values as a double. $tanh can also return values as a 128-bit decimal if the expression resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
