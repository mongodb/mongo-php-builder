            $atan2 takes any valid expression that resolves to a number.
            $atan2 returns values in radians. Use $radiansToDegrees operator to convert the output value from radians to degrees.
            By default $atan returns values as a double. $atan2 can also return values as a 128-bit decimal as long as the expression resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
