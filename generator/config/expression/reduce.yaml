type:
    - resolvesToAny
encode: object
description: |
    Applies an expression to each element in an array and combines them into a single value.
arguments:
    -
        name: input
        type:
            - resolvesToArray
        description: |
            Can be any valid expression that resolves to an array.
            If the argument resolves to a value of null or refers to a missing field, $reduce returns null.
            If the argument does not resolve to an array or null nor refers to a missing field, $reduce returns an error.
    -
        name: initialValue
        type:
            - expression
        description: |
            The initial cumulative value set before in is applied to the first element of the input array.
    -
        name: in
        type:
            - expression
        description: |
            A valid expression that $reduce applies to each element in the input array in left-to-right order. Wrap the input value with $reverseArray to yield the equivalent of applying the combining expression from right-to-left.
            During evaluation of the in expression, two variables will be available:
            - value is the variable that represents the cumulative value of the expression.
            - this is the variable that refers to the element being processed.
