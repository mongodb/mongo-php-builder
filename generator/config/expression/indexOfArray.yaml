type:
    - resolvesToInt
encode: array
description: |
    Searches an array for an occurrence of a specified value and returns the array index of the first occurrence. Array indexes start at zero.
arguments:
    -
        name: array
        type:
            - resolvesToString
        description: |
            Can be any valid expression as long as it resolves to an array.
            If the array expression resolves to a value of null or refers to a field that is missing, $indexOfArray returns null.
            If the array expression does not resolve to an array or null nor refers to a missing field, $indexOfArray returns an error.

        description: |
            An integer, or a number that can be represented as integers (such as 2.0), that specifies the starting index position for the search. Can be any valid expression that resolves to a non-negative integral number.
            If unspecified, the starting index position for the search is the beginning of the string.

        description: |
            An integer, or a number that can be represented as integers (such as 2.0), that specifies the ending index position for the search. Can be any valid expression that resolves to a non-negative integral number. If you specify a <end> index value, you should also specify a <start> index value; otherwise, $indexOfArray uses the <end> value as the <start> index value instead of the <end> value.
            If unspecified, the ending index position for the search is the end of the string.
