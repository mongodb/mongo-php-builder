type:
    - stage
encode: object
description: |
    Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal results of the recursive search for that document.
arguments:
    -
        name: from
        type:
            - string
        description: |
            Target collection for the $graphLookup operation to search, recursively matching the connectFromField to the connectToField. The from collection must be in the same database as any other collections used in the operation.
            Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the collection specified in the from parameter can be sharded.
    -
        name: startWith
        type:
            - expression
            - array
        description: |
            Expression that specifies the value of the connectFromField with which to start the recursive search. Optionally, startWith may be array of values, each of which is individually followed through the traversal process.
    -
        name: connectFromField
        type:
            - string
        description: |
            Field name whose value $graphLookup uses to recursively match against the connectToField of other documents in the collection. If the value is an array, each element is individually followed through the traversal process.
    -
        name: connectToField
        type:
            - string
        description: |
            Field name in other documents against which to match the value of the field specified by the connectFromField parameter.
    -
        name: as
        type:
            - string
        description: |
            Name of the array field added to each output document. Contains the documents traversed in the $graphLookup stage to reach the document.
    -
        name: maxDepth
        type:
            - int
        optional: true
        description: |
            Non-negative integral number specifying the maximum recursion depth.
    -
        name: depthField
        type:
            - string
        optional: true
        description: |
            Name of the field to add to each traversed document in the search path. The value of this field is the recursion depth for the document, represented as a NumberLong. Recursion depth value starts at zero, so the first lookup corresponds to zero depth.
    -
        name: restrictSearchWithMatch
        type:
            - query
        optional: true
        description: |
            A document specifying additional conditions for the recursive search. The syntax is identical to query filter syntax.
