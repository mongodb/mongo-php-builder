type:
    - stage
encode: object
description: |
    Populates null and missing field values within documents.
arguments:
    -
        name: partitionBy
        type:
            - object # of expression
            - string
        optional: true
        description: |
            Specifies an expression to group the documents. In the $fill stage, a group of documents is known as a partition.
            If you omit partitionBy and partitionByFields, $fill uses one partition for the entire collection. 
            partitionBy and partitionByFields are mutually exclusive.

        name: partitionByFields
        type:
            - array # of string
        optional: true
        description: |
            Specifies an array of fields as the compound key to group the documents. In the $fill stage, each group of documents is known as a partition.
            If you omit partitionBy and partitionByFields, $fill uses one partition for the entire collection.
            partitionBy and partitionByFields are mutually exclusive.

        name: sortBy
        type:
            - object # SortSpec
        optional: true
        description: |
            Specifies the field or fields to sort the documents within each partition. Uses the same syntax as the $sort stage.
    -
        name: output
        type:
            - object # of object{value:expression} or object{method:string}>
        description: |
            Specifies an object containing each field for which to fill missing values. You can specify multiple fields in the output object.
            The object name is the name of the field to fill. The object value specifies how the field is filled.
